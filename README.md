# cc-photon
A Pseudo-"Kernel"/OS for ComputerCraft!

**Photon uses the [more-fonts project](https://github.com/michielp1807/more-fonts) and the only modifications done was fixing photon compatibility (moving morefonts.lua into lib/ and redirecting the browser.lua (renamed to morefonts_browser) to use photon.lib.morefonts)**
